# Presenting about Git and GitHub at BDARS

On the 17th of November 2025, I have been invited to present at the Bayside District Amateur Radio Society about using Git and GitHub. The focus of the talk is in relation to amateur radio, and how Git and GitHub can be used to create personal websites and manage configurations for Radios and suchlike.

This was a unique opportunity to incorporate my knowledge as a software and platform engineer who uses these tools daily, to a group of people not quite familiar with them, but which would benefit their workflows significantly.

For Amateur Radio operators, it is particularly advantageous to have a personal website to link to for a bio and for the social aspect of Amateur Radio. GitHub Pages is a great tool for this as it is free and accessible with minimal technical know-how.
