# Sean McCullough

Hi there! I'm Sean, a software engineer based in Brisbane, Australia. I used to do freelance work, but this has now come to an end and I'm not longer taking on new clients.

## Amateur Radio

I'm a Ham! My callsign is [VK4SLM](https://www.qrz.com/db/VK4SLM). I hold my advanced certificate, so I can operate when I travel internationally as well. My primary area of focus in amateur radio is Parks on the Air. I usually perform activations on Saturdays, and hunt througout the week from the shack.

I run a Xiegu G90 in the shack and portable. I have a variety of VHF/UHF radios as well for local repeater work. I hope to expand into microwave and LF when time and money permits.

I'm a member of the [Bayside District Amateur Radio Society](https://bdars.org.au/).

## Career

**I'm currently employed and I'm not open to work.**

I have over 10 years of professional software engineering experience with a focus on web development (that's why my website is a lazy GitHub pages site!)

I have a decently broad skillset because I find every aspect of technology fascinating. I'm capable of building entire microservice-based web architectures and apps from the ground up and deploying them on web-scale infrastructure, both in the cloud and self-hosted.
